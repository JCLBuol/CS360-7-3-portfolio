Mobile app

-Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
  The weight tracker app was designed to help users track their daily weight, set weight goals, and view their weight progress over time. It aimed to address the user's need for an easy-to-use, visually appealing tool to monitor their weight management journey and maintain motivation.

  
-What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
  1. The log in screen where users could register their accounts, log in to the app, and recover lost passwords.
  2. The daily weight entry screen where the users could add the date and weights to the app, edit or delete the entries and see the list of all of their weights along with the date that they measured that weight.
  3. The permissions screen let users opt into recieveing SMS notifications.
  The UI was designed with a clean, minimalist interface, ensuring ease of use. It kept users in mind by prioritizing simplicity and providing clear feedback on their progress, motivating them to achieve their weight goals.

-How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
  I followed these coding strategies:

  1. Used Kotlin for Android development.
  2. Utilized the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture for cleaner code and separation of concerns.
  3. Employed Android's SharedPreferences for data persistence.
  4. Implemented input validation to ensure data integrity.
  These techniques can be applied in future projects to maintain code quality, readability, and scalability.

-How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
  Testing involved:

  1. Unit testing for individual functions.
  2. UI testing to ensure a smooth user experience.
  3. Manual testing to simulate real user scenarios.
  This process is vital to identify and rectify bugs, ensure the app functions as expected, and deliver a quality user experience. Testing revealed and fixed issues related to data storage, input validation, and UI responsiveness.

-Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
  Innovation was required in designing a user-friendly, interactive weight table. Leveraging Android's chart libraries, I customized graph views to display weight trends innovatively, helping users visualize their progress effectively.
  
-In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
The implementation of the weight history graph demonstrated skills in data visualization, UI design, and integration of third-party libraries. Creating an engaging, informative, and responsive table was a key aspect of the app's success in helping users track their weight effectively.
